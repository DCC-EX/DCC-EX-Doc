DCC++ & DCC++EX Public Viewable Portals                                                             Last updated 2-27-21

This file is for the DCC++ Associated Programs, Products, Websites & Support Boards that either use track or are a hybrid of the 
DCC++ Base Station &  DCC++EX Command Station platforms.

With so much history from the fall 2015 to today there is a lot of starts, stops, dead end, and misinformation floating around the internet.
People have the impression this product is either stale, buggy, pie in the sky, fresh and new, up and coming, or the greatest thing since sliced bread 
and everything in between.

This is an attempt to list the product variants and sites so that we can clear up misinformation, link associated viable products and improve awareness,
knowledge and reputability of the DCC++ family line.  "Highlighted ones Need Attention"
They should be updated or Locked where possible so people can’t download older unsupported code.

Also, Perhaps we might add a 'Third Party DCC++EX Accessories Products and Services' reference to Connections on our DCC-EX.com Site.
  i.e, JMRI, Geoff Bunza, Locoduino, RocRail, Dave Bodner, Toms Trains & Things    etc.
